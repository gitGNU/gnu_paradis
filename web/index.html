	    Extensible parallel and distributed computing networking</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            paradis is a service which uses plug-ins for its functionality,<br/>
            forming a network of computers that share CPU power. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Even if a peer do not have the plug-in to perform a task,<br/>
            it can forward the task to peers that do have the plug-in.
        </p>
        Coming soon.

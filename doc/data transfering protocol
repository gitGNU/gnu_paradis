In order to the program easy to port and make sure serialisation
protocol change does not break version compatbility we use our
own protocol for converting data to octet streams.


Primitive types:

    boolean  One bit data
    byte     One byte data
    short    Two byte data
    char     Character up to 16-bit
    wchar    Character up to 31-bit
    int      Four byte data
    long     Eight byte data
    
    
    A boolean is transfered in one byte, either of value 1 or 0.
    1 is for true, and 0 is for false. You should exception
    non-zero for true.
    
    A byte consists of 8 bits (one byte), and is encoding normally.
    
    A short consists of two bytes, the first is the most significant.
    
    An int consists of four bytes, the first is the most significant, the later the less significant.
    
    An long consists of four bytes, the first is the most significant, the later the less significant.
    
    char and wchar is encoding in UTF-8.

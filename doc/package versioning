The package is identified by three parameters:

    name          This must always be ‘paradis’, otherwise other clients will reject it

    fork path     If you write your implementation from scratch you should put your e-mail
    	          here, otherwise you should append your e-mail address with a prepended
		  slash (/) to the value in the fork you forked.
		  If you have a github account, where your fork is hosted, the github account
		  name can be used instead of your e-mail (the shorter the path is, the better.)
		  This is important because all version of all implementions should be
		  uniquely identifyable.
		  After your e-mail (or github account) you may add a plus (+) to indicate
		  fork details; for example if I, the original author, the fork path
		  ‘maandree’ and a port it to C, the fork may have to fork path
		  ‘maandree/maandree+c’, and if rewrite if from scratch in C and can use
		  the fork path ‘maandree+c’.

    version	  This insisted for four (decimal) numerical parts, separated by dots (a.b.c.d):
    		  
		  part a:    Big changes, such as implementation redesign
		  part b:    Normal changes, such as new features
		  part c:    Small changes, such as bug fixed
		  part d:    Miniscule changes, such as translations

The package should also have a reference to where you can get more information,
but if it is missing, the string should be an empty string.

The package is identified by three parameters:

    name          This must always be ‘paradis’, otherwise other clients will reject it

    fork path     If you write your implementation from scratch you should put your e-mail
    	          here, otherwise you should append your e-mail address with a prepended
		  slash (/) to the value in the fork you forked.
		  If you have a github account, where your fork is hosted, the github account
		  name can be used instead of your e-mail (the shorter the path is, the better.)
		  This is important because all version of all implementions should be
		  uniquely identifyable.

    version	  This insisted for four (decimal) numerical parts, separated by dots (a.b.c.d):
    		  
		  part a:    Big changes, such as implementation redesign
		  part b:    Normal changes, such as new features
		  part c:    Small changes, such as bug fixed
		  part d:    Miniscule changes, such as translations
